rotations and if they are connected to their neighbours. 
- If the position is negative, it means that the piece is stored in the tray.

Load game

Piece behaviour
- Each puzzle piece has an index, a position on the board, a rotation, and reference to its (maximum) 4 neighbours. 
- Each piece when dropped does a neighbour check against its list of neighbours. If it is within a distance, they 
connect, and move as a unit. One transformation made on one of them is copied to the other. 
- 


The user can drag each piece with left mouse drag. When pressing on a piece it rotates clock wise. 

When dragging a peace to its neighbour they connect and act like one island. Movements, rotations 
are performed for the entire island. 

 To do: 
 - add image viewer for selected image. 
 - Make dropdown for piece count
 - Make use rotation as a const
 
 - Add hint button?
