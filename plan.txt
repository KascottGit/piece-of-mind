Make a start page where the player choses an image, the number of pieces, wether or not you can 
rotate the pieces. 

It then opens a new screen with the a jumbled pile of pieces. 

Buttons at the top: 
 - Button to space them out around the puzzle board. 
 - Button to only view edges. 
 - Button to toggle finished image overlay. 
 - Button to bring up image. 

The user can drag each piece with left mouse drag. When pressing on a piece it rotates clock wise. 

When dragging a peace to its neighbour they connect and act like one island. Movements, rotations 
are performed for the entire island. 

Piece behaviour: 
 - rotation
 - Movement
 - neighbour checks
